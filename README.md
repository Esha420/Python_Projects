## Overview

This SMS Spam Classifier allows users to input a message (SMS) and classify it as either **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The project uses a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer for text feature extraction, and various machine learning models such as **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Voting Classifier** for prediction.

The app provides an easy-to-use interface built with **Streamlit**.
